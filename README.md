* [Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHNfobG-36s&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DKGFCm0YRVRXZMO1KHNUXu): discussed design and purpose of the programming language, implemented the parser for variable assignment and function call syntax. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/cde5753d14021958374651c26960b48b880ac25e))
* [Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCOY0xcI2iE&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DKGFCm0YRVRXZMO1KHNUXu): implemented built-in runtime functions and user-defined functions. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/3a0dbb1a1509fce6e3738311abcc2e8521d4bf46))
* [Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRg2OcuZ-jU&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DKGFCm0YRVRXZMO1KHNUXu): wrote a run script to conviniently execute programs in the X language. Implemented code blocks which are similar to anonymous function
expressions in JS, and use that and a runtime $if function to implement conditionals instead of an if statement. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/75eb66bd4211fb2e62a6fcc90bfd8999445f23ba))
* [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en4nUODGC6I): implemented array literals, `each`, `map`, `filter` and `reduce` functions and added parameters to code blocks. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/aad292e356271b269dd3a59c34ef843549843aef))
* [Episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME6Msxff8xI): implemented implicit returns and tags for collection types. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/7a6c7935f6be70394657db28c15a1e8b5b62f672))
