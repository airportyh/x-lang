([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/cde5753d14021958374651c26960b48b880ac25e)
* [Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCOY0xcI2iE&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DKGFCm0YRVRXZMO1KHNUXu): implemented built-in runtime functions and user-defined functions. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/3a0dbb1a1509fce6e3738311abcc2e8521d4bf46)
* [Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRg2OcuZ-jU&list=PLSq9OFrD2Q3DKGFCm0YRVRXZMO1KHNUXu): wrote a run script to conviniently execute programs in the X language. Implemented code blocks which are similar to anonymous function
expressions in JS, and use that and a runtime $if function to implement conditionals instead of an if statement. ([commit](https://github.com/airportyh/x-lang/commit/75eb66bd4211fb2e62a6fcc90bfd8999445f23ba)
